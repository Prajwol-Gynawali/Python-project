    #### Description:

                        The Smart Expense Tracker is a Python-based personal finance management application designed to help users monitor their income, expenses, and necessary recurring payments in a clear and organized manner. Its primary goal is to provide a simple yet functional command-line interface that allows users to track their financial activities, view detailed transaction histories, and manage necessary expenses such as rent, utilities, food, and other recurring payments. By storing data in CSV files and using the tabulate library for clean table formatting, the program ensures that financial tracking is both practical and easy to read, even for users with minimal technical background. The project demonstrates a thorough understanding of core Python concepts, including functions, file input/output, loops, conditional statements, and modular design. It is also structured to meet CS50P project requirements, including having a main function, multiple additional functions, and testable components.
                        This Tool is usefull for those who cant manage their expenses . espically, for collage students who are trying to work while studying to fullfill their expenses goal alongside.
                        The main file of the project, project.py, contains all the program logic. Upon starting, the user is prompted to enter a username, which creates or loads a corresponding CSV file for storing transactions. The program provides options to add income, record expenses, delete expenses by their unique ID, view all transactions, and check the current balance. Users can also manage necessary expenses through a dedicated menu that allows adding, viewing, and removing essential payments. Expenses recorded in the general expense tracker automatically update the corresponding necessary expense if it matches, ensuring that users always have an accurate view of how much of their required payments remain. All menus, transactions, and balances are displayed in neatly formatted tables using tabulate to improve readability and user experience.
                        The project also includes requirements.txt, which lists external dependencies needed to run the program. In this case, the only external library is tabulate, which can be installed using pip install -r requirements.txt. Another key file, test_project.py, contains automated tests written with pytest for at least three core functions, such as adding money, recording expenses, and checking balances. These tests verify that the functions behave as expected and help ensure that future modifications do not break the program’s core functionality.
                        Several design choices were made to enhance usability and maintainability. CSV-based storage was chosen because it is simple, human-readable, and easy to manipulate with Python. Incremental IDs were used for all transactions and necessary expenses to simplify deletion and management. The program separates necessary expenses from general expenses to provide clear visibility into recurring obligations, automatically updating the records when matching expenses are recorded. Functions are modular and top-level, improving readability, testability, and ease of future expansion. User-friendly loops allow users to perform multiple actions without repeatedly navigating menus, enhancing the overall user experience.
                        In conclusion, the Smart Expense Tracker is a fully functional, user-friendly command-line application that effectively helps individuals manage their personal finances. It combines Python programming, file handling, and user interface design in a cohesive manner while meeting all CS50P project requirements. With features such as detailed transaction tracking, real-time balance calculation, and automatic updates for necessary payments, this project is both practical and educational. Its modular design allows for easy future enhancements, such as analytics, reporting, or additional expense categories, making it a robust foundation for personal finance management.
